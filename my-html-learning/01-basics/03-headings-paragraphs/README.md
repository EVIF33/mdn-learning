# Headings and Paragraphs

## What to remember

- **H1** — one per page, main heading.
- **Do not skip levels**: H1 → H2 → H3 (not H1 → H3)
- **Tag ≠ size**: Choose tags based on meaning, not font size
- **Semantics are important**: `<h1>` is better than `<span>` with a large font

## Why is this important?

- **SEO**: Search engines take headlines into account.
- **Accessibility**: Screen readers are used for navigation.
- **Readability**: Users scan by headings.
